Phase 2

What I Did:
In Phase 2, I had to program the shape I drew in Processing.

How I Did It:

I started with the basic code given in the assignment:

def setup():
    size(150, 150)
    noStroke()

    def draw():
        fill(0)
        rect(40, 10,  60, 10)

From there, I plugged in my other shapes and adjusted their positions to get:

    rect(40, 70, 60, 10)
    rect(50, 40, 40, 40)
    ellipse(70, 80, 30, 30)

My Issues:

I had to figure out how programming the coordinates in worked, but I was able to pick up on how it worked quickly.
