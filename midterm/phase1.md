Phase 1

What We Did:
In Phase 1, we drew a sketch of our shape. I wanted to draw Jamiroquai with a head and a hat.

How I Did It:
I drew a circle for the head, and used two rectangles for the hat. I adjusted the various dimensions to get the right shape that I wanted, so I ended up with a 6 by 1 rectangle as the brim, a 4 by 4 square as the hat and a 3 by 3 circle for the head.
