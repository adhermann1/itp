Final Project Proposal

What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My project will be called Awesome Weather App or something like that.

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a web-based weather app based on a given location.

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using the OpenWeatherMap Weather API, my software will take an inputted location, such as the name of a city, and will tell the user the temperature, kind of weather, what temperature it feels like and the high and low for the day. This will be executed from importing the API's web data into the program, then manipulating these values to read correctly so that the user may simply input a city name.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project would be to be able to tell the user the weather of one city.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be having the prograam be able to tell the user the temperature in any city.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be being able to tell the user the different weather conditions in any city within the database from simply typing the name in.

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

As I continue on this project, I will need to continue learning about API's and how they work, as well as navigating the OpenWeatherMap API specifically and learning how to best implement it into my code. I also have to learn some more about the code itself, as I am only beginning to learn about using API's and web-based programming. I will have to learn how to take a written value, input it into a database, and then output a statement with data points all in one program.

List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

I will be using the OpenWeatherMap API, Dr. Rome, my classmates, youtube, reddit and any reliable information I can find.
