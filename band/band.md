**Problems faced, decisions made**

While making our website, we had trouble making one of our links work. Initially, we input the link as if it were another text, expecting it to be clickable, but it was not. Then, we looked at the sample website and took the href="#"> and used it to start on our link. Our link highlighted and underlined, but was still not clickable. We then realized that our link was after the >, and had to be within the quotation marks.

**A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group**

I provided the text for the paragraph using ChatGPT and my imagination, as well as advising on how the href had to be used. I also helped figure out how to get the website on the internet. Additonally, I made sure my group mates knew the criteria for the project and that we accounted for everything.

**Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made**

We worked on Misha's laptop, so he was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of putting in all of the code. He did a good job of noticing and trying to mend problem.

Ray helped with scaling and the href code, and did a good job of pulling influence from the provided website.
